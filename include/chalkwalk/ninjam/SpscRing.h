// A single-producer, single-consumer ring of pointers.
//
// The primitive the RX path needs to stop taking a lock on the audio thread.
// Two rings per stream carry ownership in a circle without either side ever
// waiting for the other:
//
//   ready:   network thread -> audio thread   ("here is a decoded interval")
//   retired: audio thread   -> network thread ("done with this one, free it")
//
// The retire direction is the load-bearing half. The audio thread must never
// drop the last reference to a DecodedInterval, because that frees a
// multi-megabyte buffer inside the callback. Handing the pointer back and
// letting the owning thread release it keeps deallocation off the audio thread
// entirely.
//
// Deliberately holds raw pointers, not shared_ptr: copying a shared_ptr touches
// an atomic refcount, and destroying one can free. Ownership lives in the
// producer's own container for the whole time a pointer is in flight.
//
// Exactly one thread may push and exactly one may pop. With more of either the
// index arithmetic is wrong, and nothing here will tell you.
